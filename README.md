# Waste-Classification
To develop a CNN model for classifying images of plastic waste, you'll follow a series of steps, including data collection, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.For the Data Collection step, the goal is to gather and prepare a dataset of images for your CNN model.

## Project Description
Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the *Waste Classification Data* by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: *Organic* and *Recyclable*. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

### Key Details:
- *Total Images*: 25,077
  - *Training Data*: 22,564 images (85%)
  - *Test Data*: 2,513 images (15%)
- *Classes*: Organic and Recyclable
- *Purpose*: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.

### Approach:
- Studied waste management strategies and white papers.
- Analyzed the composition of household waste.
- Segregated waste into two categories (Organic and Recyclable).
- Leveraged IoT and machine learning to automate waste classification.

### Dataset Link:
You can access the dataset here: [Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).

Note: Ensure appropriate dataset licensing and usage guidelines are followed.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
- *Convolutional Layers:* Feature extraction
- *Pooling Layers:* Dimensionality reduction
- *Fully Connected Layers:* Classification
- *Activation Functions:* ReLU and Softmax

## Training
- *Optimizer:* Adam
- *Loss Function:* Categorical Crossentropy
- *Epochs:* Configurable (default: 25)
- *Batch Size:* Configurable (default: 32)

Data augmentation techniques were utilized to enhance model performance and generalizability.
